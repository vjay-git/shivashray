This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Mock API Mode (For Static Deployment)

This project includes a mock API mode that allows you to deploy the frontend to static hosting services like Netlify without requiring a backend API.

### How to Enable Mock API Mode

**Option 1: Don't set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL** (Recommended for Netlify)
- Simply don't set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable
- Mock mode will be enabled automatically

**Option 2: Explicitly enable it**
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=true` in your environment variables

### Environment Variables

For **Mock Mode** (Static Deployment):
```bash
# No API URL needed - mock mode will be used automatically
# Or explicitly:
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=true
```

For **Real API Mode**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_API=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api/v1
```

### What Mock Mode Provides

The mock API provides sample data for:
- Room types and rooms listing
- Services
- User authentication (demo user)
- Bookings (stored in memory during session)

**Note:** Mock mode is perfect for showcasing the UI/UX, but data will not persist between page refreshes and is not suitable for production use with real bookings.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
